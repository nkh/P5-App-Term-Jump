search ->only in DB and in filesystem is none found
complete -> Db, filesystem, part of db
	because we want to emulate cd as naturaly as possible thus looking for matches localy before looking at ub DB entries
	maybe sub db entries should not be returned if no direct match!

remove package globals

test for entries containing space
	test quoting

error: xt/author/ last slash stops the matching of db entry
	entry in db does not have ending /

error: xt/auth   does not match /tmp/devel/xt/author

error: cdd devel returns two matches but cdd devel/ just one, should be two

why are we using length  instead for weight or path weight and why is the first b <=> c and the second a <=> b?
	for my $db_entry (sort {length($b) <=> length($a) || $a cmp $b} keys %{$db})

option to quote or zero results for bash

option to not traverse specific directories while searching
	IE: git directories
	
Match matrice
	single/multiple
	directory weight
	path weight
	alpha

	db not db
	under cwd
	under db entry
