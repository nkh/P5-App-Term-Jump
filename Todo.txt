? when matching multiple directories with a single word, entries are cut at the natching directory, IE:

search: perl
db:
	/perl
	/perl/sub
	/perl/sub/sub

only /perl is returned because that's what we are looking for 

=> works fine in search mode but not in completion mode
=> when -F is given, the to potential directories with the file are not searched as they are not returned


! --interactive
	can be done with external program and --complete

--alias the_alias directory|cwd

--source option to define what cwd is 
	as jump --complete start from current directory and find all matches below it
		this is an error!
			--find should handle that

--file regex search for the first directory in the DB that containsthe file
		also works with complete
			display tree like like ra find
	
Match matrice
	single/multiple
	directory weight
	path weight
	alpha

	db not db
	under cwd
	under db entry
